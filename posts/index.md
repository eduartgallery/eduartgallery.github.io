<center>A painter is defined by his works, their creation being based on all the senses along with the talent, experience and the joy of fulfilment of each painting.  When we refer to senses, not only the seeing which is essential Ã®n creating the visual art, but also the others bring their plentitude in accomplishing the artistic making. A painter who doesn't save anything,  doesn't plan and doesn't save energy, color, but even is generous and giving,  all these to the enjoyment of those who demand for beauty. A wonderful painter, with wonderful works.</center>
